          My journey began with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science

          tech world, honing my skills in both front-end and back-end

          <p>
            Currently, I work at Bazaar Technologies as a Software Engineer -
            II, where I lead the development of a React web portal for our
            partners, significantly improving user engagement and experience.
            One of my proudest achievements here was automating invoice
            generation, which streamlined our internal processes and reduced
            manual workload. I also enjoy mentoring junior developers, guiding
            them through best practices and fostering their growth.

          Previously, I held the role of Front End Engineer at Orcalo Holdings,
          where I managed a team of 24 junior developers. I introduced effective
          design patterns and improved our client-server communication layer,
          ensuring timely project delivery and high-quality results.
