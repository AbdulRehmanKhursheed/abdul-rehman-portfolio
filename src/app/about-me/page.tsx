          Hello! üëãüëã, I&apos;m Abdul Rehman, a passionate software engineer
          with over {calculateExperience()} years of experience in full-stack
          development. I specialize in creating robust, scalable web
          applications, leveraging technologies such as React, Angular, Node.js,
          and Spring Boot.

        <br />

        <p>
          My journey began with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science
          from Hitec University. Since then, I&apos;ve immersed myself in the
          tech world, honing my skills in both front-end and back-end
          development. I pride myself on employing agile methodologies,
          Test-Driven Development (TDD), and SOLID principles in my work, which
          not only improves code quality but also enhances team collaboration
          and efficiency.

            Currently, I work at Bazaar Technologies as a Software Engineer -

            partners, significantly improving user engagement and experience.
            One of my proudest achievements here was automating invoice
            generation, which streamlined our internal processes and reduced
            manual workload. I also enjoy mentoring junior developers, guiding
            them through best practices and fostering their growth.
